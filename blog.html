                <h2>Here's why Taylor Swift is re-recording her old albums!</h2>
                <p>
                    Taylor Swift's ongoing feud with Scooter Braun has become intense. In a Tumblr post, Swift explained
                    everything and how she feels betrayed about the whole deal that went down behind her back.
                    "For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work. Instead I was given an opportunity to sign
                    back up to Big Machine Records and ‘earn’ one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned
                    in. I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label,
                    thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past.
                    Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned
                    playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums.
                    <br>
                    Some fun facts about today’s news: I learned about Scooter Braun’s purchase of my masters as it was
                    announced to the world. All I could think about was the incessant, manipulative bullying I’ve
                    received at his hands for years.
                    <br>
                    Like when Kim Kardashian orchestrated an illegally recorded snippet of a phone call to be leaked and
                    then Scooter got his two clients together to bully me online about it. (See photo) Or when his
                    client, Kanye West, organized a revenge porn music video which strips my body naked. Now Scooter has
                    stripped me of my life’s work, that I wasn’t given an opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical
                    legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.
                    <br>
                    This is my worst case scenario. This is what happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for
                    whom the term ‘loyalty’ is clearly just a contractual concept. And when that man says ‘Music has
                    value’, he means its value is beholden to men who had no part in creating it.
                    <br>
                    When I left my masters in Scott’s hands, I made peace with the fact that eventually he would sell
                    them. Never in my worst nightmares did I imagine the buyer would be Scooter. Any time Scott
                    Borchetta has heard the words ‘Scooter Braun’ escape my lips, it was when I was either crying or
                    trying not to. He knew what he was doing; they both did. Controlling a woman who didn’t want to be
                    associated with them. In perpetuity. That means forever.
                    <br>
                    Thankfully, I am now signed to a label that believes I should own anything I create. Thankfully, I
                    left my past in Scott’s hands and not my future. And hopefully, young artists or kids with musical
                    dreams will read this and learn about how to better protect themselves in a negotiation. You deserve
                    to own the art you make.

                    I will always be proud of my past work."

                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type

                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
