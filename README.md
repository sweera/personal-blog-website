Epiphany	


Epiphany is a personal blogging website. It is a one stop for all pop culture and travel updates. It talks about what is latest in the world of television, music and travel destinations. This 
project came into being when I started pursuing the Nanodegree program at Udacity. I thought it would be good to create something while brushing up my skills in Front-end.
